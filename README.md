# AR Preview

Hi!

We're currently working on a way to allow people to preview their wall decorations in 
their actual living rooms. To be able to achieve this, we have built a custom AR 
implementation in both our editor platforms. Technically we're almost there. 
Design-wise however we might need a little help. 

That's where you come in. Our UX team has created a basic outline for what the 
[visual implementation](https://www.figma.com/file/SEtCP3mNkzNcIlYhDwkwH4/A.R.-Online-Editor?node-id=189-154&t=XmCYoMqq89oUFyiD-0) 
might look like. Our frontend team has built you this little playground, in which
you will try as best you can to achieve this design. We encourage you to use
TypeScript, it is however not a requirement. The use of React _is_.

What we need you to do is complete the following steps: 
1. Create a message balloon that prompts the user to try out our AR preview. 
2. Create a window that displays a short description of augmented reality. It must also give the user the option to either get started or to decline. 
3. Should the user choose to get started with augmented reality, open a modal or update the contents of the current modal with a QR code that redirects to the augmented reality module (you can use an example QR code, as we do not expect you to create a full AR implementation in a few hours). Next to the QR code a small bit of explanatory text should be visible. 

Good luck! And should you have questions, feel free to ask Jelle or anyone else you run into!
